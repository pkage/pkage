### Hi there ðŸ›°

I do research that looks at how we can train better AIs with unreliable data at the [University of Edinburgh](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai).

I also write code that interacts with spacecraft, the web, and sometimes other domains.

If either of these are interesting to you, please [don't hesitate to get in touch](mailto:patrick@ka.ge?subject=Hello%21).
